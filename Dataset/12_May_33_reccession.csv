Their speech will be as much of a lie as their silence now"

2023-05-12 23:55:14+00:00,Just about every macro- economist and every strategist is calling for a summer recession. When everyone has the same outlook on the market is when the market most surprises in terms of direction
2023-05-12 23:55:04+00:00,"Inflation is not being propelled by an overheated economy. It‚Äôs being propelled by overheated profits.

Democrats must get serious about tackling this. Otherwise, Fed rate hikes will push the economy toward a recession that could hit right around the next election.

2023-05-12 23:48:52+00:00,@rocketrepreneur @Noahpinion Right. What did it take? A growing economy and Dem president. Obama inherited the Great Recession. A GQP program.
