Revenue has gone down quite a bit last 12 months though. Basically since the recession. Slowly picking up again.

2023-05-06 12:49:30+00:00,@byrcza @helmuts_reinis @CryptoDefarmer @runews If anything our economy is too good. We have record low unemployment which drives up wages. That is the source of inflation. If we have a hot economy or mild recession our fundamentals are incredibly strong. A thousand times better than Russia.
2023-05-06 12:49:08+00:00,@POTUS Yeah but the 3 month average showed jobs collapsed. World recession coming on in Q3 Q4 2023 woth est interest rates in 24 to be over 12.5% thanks to Briben Biden.

One major reason for this $7 trillion was the huge amount of borrowing for the US's response to the global coronavirus pandemic, which overturned the economy &amp;  triggered a recession.  $3 trillion was borrowed to cover the costs of the COVID relief plans"
2023-05-06 12:46:12+00:00,@WaitCapital The consumer isn’t buying more. They are paying more for the same amount of product. Dollars are up.  EQ are not. The recession will be one of mix where shoppers move down in quality on staples and reduce / eliminate discretionary. It’s happening now. Just slowly

2023-05-06 12:45:31+00:00,@DemFromCT No signs of a recession yet the constant drumbeat is that a recession may be coming. Biden's campaign needs social media images of highway and bridge construction and manufacturing facilities construction showing how his policies are working. Flood the zone with accomplishments.

2023-05-06 12:40:20+00:00,"@HillaryClinton It's a historical fact that unemployment drops right before a recession.   Banks are failing, people are being laid off, the dollar and US global influence is waning, and the rest if the world laughs at us as Americans struggle to define a woman.  I'm not sure this is good news."
