Either pass their devastating cuts, including the risk of millions losing Medicaid and sweeping education cuts.
 
Or default on our debt ‚Äì erasing millions of jobs and triggering a recession."
2023-05-11 23:57:29+00:00,@JoJoFromJerz ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù a recession?  Have you been living under a rock?  We are already in one!
2023-05-11 23:57:22+00:00,"Granted tipped jobs are always a crapshoot depending on where you work and how big the receipts are but... what? Right up to the 2008 recession I was like ""huh I could probably rent a shitty apartment on just part time hours"" and now that's like... a hallucination."
2023-05-11 23:57:11+00:00,@JoeBiden There will be a resurgence of inflation when you quit raiding the Strategic Oil Reserve. Your excessive spending fuels inflation while the Fed raises interest rates to fight inflation. The economy is slowing into a recession. If GDP is less than inflation are we growing?
2023-05-11 23:57:09+00:00,@eliant_capital Mild CPI and PPI drive them. Disinflationary trades plus a chance of recession element imho. Dow has defensive ones and was used as inflation hedge now less useful.
2023-05-11 23:56:54+00:00,"@realTuckFrumper @Kafka1057 Trump is Putin‚Äôs mouthpiece, he brought Putin‚Äôs message to the Town Hall:  Default on the debt ceiling.  Cause the market to crash, cause a recession and put millions out of work, global market chaos.  Trump did as he was told.  Probably paid well to do it."
2023-05-11 23:56:53+00:00,@CalltoActivism If they do it won‚Äôt put us into a recession it would put us into a Depression. Our economy woul crash thousands upon thousands would be laid off and starve.
2023-05-11 23:56:40+00:00,"@koolkaryn @FeliciaP1204 @CalltoActivism You call that thing a source? üòÇüòÇü§° All it does is further solidify the fact that democrats and libtards can‚Äôt meme. Now do that same chart under Biden: Dems voted for higher inflation, higher gas prices, recession-like growth, rampant crime, record illegal immigration, etc, etc"
2023-05-11 23:56:14+00:00,@budsbillsallday @JustinTrudeau And we were in a recession in 2008-2009 when conservatives were in power. What‚Äôs the point?
