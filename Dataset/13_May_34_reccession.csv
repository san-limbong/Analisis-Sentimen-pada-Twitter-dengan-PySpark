It's not an option."

2023-05-13 14:47:04+00:00,@POTUS To whoever is actually running this account. We‚Äôre already in a recession. If not a depression. Shut up.
2023-05-13 14:46:50+00:00,"@KimDotcom Leave it to a right winger to consider recession, surrendering to Putin, leaving the world susceptible to authoritarianism and turning America into a third world country a ‚Äúgood thing.‚Äù"

2023-05-13 14:46:36+00:00,"@POTUS A recession is coming regardless of political stunts from either side. 

Just ask any economist or finance person. 

Y'all simply printed too much money."
2023-05-13 14:46:27+00:00,"@SpeakerMcCarthy Of course. Because you misjudged your leverage and, in the process, gave him what he desperately needed: someone else to blame the upcoming recession on."
2023-05-13 14:46:21+00:00,"@FinPlanKaluAja1 With ur sensational analysis. Without borrowing, we wont exit the 2016 recession  without, no project'll be completed. What Buhari did, no other president had the balls to do it. Old cities connected, airports, sea ports,networkof roads, bridges, power projects,military assets"

2023-05-13 14:45:57+00:00,"A year ago Germany argued against embargo on Russian gas to avoid deep recession. So, Russia continued to get paid and used this cash to kill in Ukraine. 

But the recession was never a real risk. Politicians were afraid and ignored the facts. See the study by @ben_moll 1/"
2023-05-13 14:45:36+00:00,"@johnredwood So, remind me - who's going to fill all the vacancies we have? While our own population is ageing, we need immigration to keep the economy from decades of recession."
2023-05-13 14:45:19+00:00,"Now that we're 1 year removed from peak ""there were 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, therefore we're in a recession,"" can we agree that no recession has actually started yet and the ""2 quarters of negative GDP growth"" heuristic as an absolute rule was always wrong?"
2023-05-13 14:45:17+00:00,"@crypto_birb I believe this suggests markets may be under pressure if the economy is headed into recession and likely bottoms prior to the economy recovering. 

If so, question is has a soft landing been engineered or is recession perhaps even something breaking ahead. 

What do you think?"
2023-05-13 14:45:14+00:00,@tegelad @SpeakerMcCarthy There is no negotiation on the debt ceiling! It is NOT a budget issue! The RepubliKLAN Party is trying to force through BUDGET cuts under the guise of the debt ceiling! These DEBTS are ALREADY incurred! RepubliKLANs are playing games that will cause a recession! SIMPLE!!
2023-05-13 14:45:09+00:00,@POTUS You already put us in a recession

Another crisis you make so you have something to run on next election?"

Their speech will be as much of a lie as their silence now"

2023-05-13 14:42:57+00:00,"MAGA Republicans in Congress have offered us two options:
 
Either pass their devastating cuts, including the risk of millions losing Medicaid and sweeping education cuts.

You can pull up the charts and you will see it clearly.

If we dont see unemployment up we will not have recession, but this is very unlikely."
2023-05-13 14:41:10+00:00,"@kimguilfoyle Peace &amp; Prosperity, huh?

Jan 6th 2021 showed us all Trump's idea of peace.

And the fact that he put us into the worst recession in history due to his mishandling the pandemic shows us exactly what kind of ""prosperity"" he has in mind."
2023-05-13 14:41:06+00:00,"@TheBon_Scott @LizYoungStrat @verrone_chris @StrategasRP That's a false construct.
The 10Y yield can decline during periods of GDP expansion when disinflationary fed policy are in force. Fed fund's are above the clearing price for credit expansion or during QE.

Declining E during an earnings recession generally lead to higher PEs."
