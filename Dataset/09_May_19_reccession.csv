2023-05-09 14:40:32+00:00,@Sukitbackrow @RepWeinstein They were the folks who made out like bandits in 2008 during the Great Recession &amp; they wanted to recreate that
2023-05-09 14:40:09+00:00,@RBReich Where is the RECESSION slowing? For middle class and fixed income? Middle class is dying.
2023-05-09 14:39:39+00:00,"@RepWeinstein @JustWhatNowWhy They're tanking the economy on purpose to blame Democrats in 2024 for the mess the GOP created. Even in a recession, the rich get richer who cares if poor Americans die in the streets."

2023-05-09 14:38:32+00:00,@WallStreetSilv Lol. Tell me this has anything to do with a recession. Or anything else besides employees not wanting to work for a shitty manager.
2023-05-09 14:37:47+00:00,@l78lancer Yes the republicans had to spend because we went into a recession because clinton paid off the debt as much as he could by taking more money out then spending in.
2023-05-09 14:37:37+00:00,"@riteshmjn @PopcornWatching This seems a bit of a narrow view on BoC rate implications. On one hand, yes they have the power to kick a recession down the road once again like in 2008 sending asset values to the moon and devaluaing savings &amp; future earnings. The middle class is already priced out."

The economy is booming. Sorry, canâ€™t have it both ways-Trumpâ€™s little recession by incompetence was not good. Bidenâ€™s policies helped us recover in record time."
